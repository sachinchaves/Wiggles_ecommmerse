                            <h2>I'm Jac</h2>
                            <p>When Jac adopted Bella, the first of three rescue pugs, she knew right away she never wanted to compromise when it came to Bella’s comfort. Jac wanted to find a coat to protect Bella from the harsh Canadian winters so they could both enjoy more time together outdoors. The problem was Jac couldn’t find anything that offered Bella the protection she needed that also had that style and quality that Jac was looking for.</p>
                            <p>This was Jac’s light bulb moment. She knew there were other pet parents who also cared about function, quality and style just like her. After 10 years, Canada Pooch has over 5,000 dedicated retail partners and a community of satisfied pet parents that love our amazing selection of comfortable, durable and fashionable products for all seasons, and Jac and the team hope you’ll think so too. </p>
